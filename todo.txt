Have good data, need...
 modify team.py to accomodate additional features
 modify loaddata to read from csv's ('year raw')
 update functions for team.py
 load historical data into team.py, such that it can output results based on history (basically all games
  need a time tag so that function calls (with a time tag input) can only return historical data)
